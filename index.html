            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p class="columns">
                In 1994, there was an event that totally changed the concept of code reading, that is the advent of the QR Code system.
                It was developed by engineers working for DENSO WAVE. Masahiro Hara, who took the lead in the development, spoke about its secret history, and Atsushi Tano, who is engaged in the system solution business, offering services/systems utilizing QR Code, spoke about the future vision.

                QR codes may be considered easier to scan compared to 1D barcodes, 
                as they can be scanned in any direction, whereas 1D barcodes have to be scanned 
                from the proper angle.
                QR codes and barcodes are both machine-readable. Unlike the standard 1D barcode,
                QR codes can store information in two directions (horizontally and vertically) 
                while 1D barcodes can only store information in one direction – horizontally. 
                This allows them to hold much more information, a 1D barcode can typically store 
                about 20 to 25 characters, although some variations can store more. A QR code, on the other hand,
                 can store up to 2,509 numeric characters or 1,520 alpha-numeric characters.

                        QR codes may seem geeky, but it is not necessary to understand the 
                        complex technology behind them. Just know that there are two pieces 
                        to using QR codes: someone has to generate the code, and then the user 
                        has to scan the code to read it. To create a QR code you will need a QR code generator,
                        to generate your QR Code follow &#x1F449;

                        Wondering how to decode a QR Code? You can scan it with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPad, 
                        Android or Blackberry equipped with additional software for scanning QR Codes.
                        You can also select an image file that contains a QR Code and the program will locate it automatically and decode it.
                        To do that, simply follow &#x1F449;
